# HandCar

This is the code for a small car made with an Arduino. And how is it controlled? The Arduino receives through the serial port the information collected from Leap Motion, which has previously been processed by the Python code. In this way, the car will move depending on the inclination of the right hand.

###### This project is still under development.
